# Eye Boundaries Detector

This project is something simple I did for image processing class. It detects the boundaries between the pupil and the iris and between the iris and the sclera. The original image is stored in the "Input_Image" folder, and the detected circles are stored in the folder named "Output_Images". Also the corresponding edge maps are stored in the  "Edge_Maps" folder.
